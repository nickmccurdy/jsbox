  p A simple tool for experimenting with JS libraries in your web console.
  p.
    You may use the field below to pick JavaScript libraries to load. Once you
    press "Load", the page will be reloaded with the libraries of your choice
    included. To use your web console with these libraries, simply open it up on
    this page and hack away.
  p.
    Please note that jQuery and Chosen will be loaded at all times, as JS Box
    uses them internally.
